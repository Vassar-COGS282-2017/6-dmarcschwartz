# You should first calculate the activation of the hidden layer, and then calculate the activation
# of the output layer. We're going to need both sets of activations in the backprop method, so I've
# written the return() statement to return both hidden.layer and output.layer activations. Your
# job is to create the hidden.layer and output.layer variables in the appropriate way.
# Don't forget to use the sigmoid.activation function created above.

# Now we can write the backward pass, or the backprop function.
# The input will be a vector that is n.inputs long
# The output will be a vector that is n.output long
# Backprop is very similar to the delta rule, with a few modifications. In fact, the delta rule is 
# a special case of backprop. As a reminder, this is the Delta rule:
# change.in.weight.from.i.to.j = learning.rate * error.in.j * activation.of.i
# One piece of the delta rule that is commonly left out, and we did this in our example in class, is the 
# derivative of the activation function of node j. We left this out because we used the activation
# function output = x, so the derivative is 1 (The derivative describes the rate of change of output as 
# x changes. When output = x, a change of 1 in x will cause a corresponding change of 1 in output).
# However, now we are using the sigmoid activation function, so we need to include this derivative term again.
# The full delta rule is therefore:
# change.in.weight.from.i.to.j = learning.rate * error.in.j * derivative.of.activation.funtion.for.j.at.current.activation.level
# * activation.of.i
# This equation will describe all of the weight updates that we do in backprop. The only missing piece is how to get the error
# terms for the hidden layer units. We know the error for the output, but need to back-propogate this error to the hidden layer.
# I'll describe how this works below.

backprop <- function(input, target, input.to.hidden.weights, hidden.to.output.weights)
{
  
  # Step 1. Because we are going to modify the weights in stages, we need to create
  # copies of the weights so that we don't overwrite the original weights before we are
  # done with them. Really, all we need are matrices of the right size to hold the delta
  # (change in) weights, but we can get a matrix of the right size by copying the weight
  # matrices. We'll overwrite all the values before we are done.
  delta.hidden.to.output.weights <- hidden.to.output.weights
  delta.input.to.hidden.weights <- input.to.hidden.weights
  
  # Step 2. Calculate the forward pass on the network. This gets us the activity of the
  # hidden and output layers for a particular set of inputs.
  activations <- forward.pass(input, input.to.hidden.weights, hidden.to.output.weights)
  output.activation <- activations$output
  hidden.activation <- activations$hidden
  
  # Step 3. Find the error on the output units. We can find the error just like we did 
  # with the delta rule. Just subtract the actual output from the desired output.
  output.desired.activation <- target
  output.error <-  output.desired.activation - output.activation # replace NA with correct code.
  
  # Step 4. We need to multiply the error for a node (an element in the output.error vector)
  # by the derivative of the activation function for the node. The activation function is the
  # sigmoid function: z = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)). The derivative of this function is z * (1 - z).
  # Calculate a "weighted" error in two steps:
  # 1) Find the derivative (slope) for each output node at the level of activation of that node.
  # 2) Multiple this by the node's error to get the weighted error.
  output.slope <- sigmoid.activation(input) * (1 - sigmoid.activation(input))
  output.weighted.error <- output.slope * output.error
  
  # Step 5. Find the change in the hidden to output weights by applying the delta rule, using the
  # weighted error instead of the error.
  for(o in 1:n.output)
  {
    delta.hidden.to.output.weights[,o] <- learning.rate * output.weighted.error * hidden.activation
  }
  
  # Step 6. Now we need to "backpropogate" the error from the output nodes to the hidden nodes,
  # so that we can apply the delta rule to the hidden nodes. How much error should we assign to
  # each hidden node? It turns out that the right way to do this is to multiply the error by the
  # connection weight for each node. Each weight will have some error associated with it, and then
  # we sum up all the errors for each hidden node. This makes some intuitive sense. If a hidden node
  # is strongly connected to an output node, then it contributed a lot to the error of that node. If
  # a hidden node has almost no connection (weight near 0), then it contributed very little to the
  # error of the node.
  hidden.error <- delta.hidden.to.output.weights*output.error
  
  # Step 7. Just like the output layer, we need to calculate the weighted error for the hidden nodes.
  hidden.slope <- sigmoid.activation(input) * (1 - sigmoid.activation(input))
  hidden.weighted.error <- hidden.slope * hidden.error
  
  # Step 8. Apply the delta rule using the weighted errors.
  for(h in 1:n.hidden)
  {
    delta.input.to.hidden.weights[,h] <- learning.rate * hidden.weighted.error * input.activation
